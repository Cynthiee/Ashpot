As long as we all grow our own wheat and corn, and stitch our 
own clothes, and churn our own butter, and make our own shoes, we need nobody else.
We aren’t even thinking of anyone else.
We’re only thinking of how to find enough time in the day to grow vegetables,
feed the goats, shear the sheep, and shoe the horses. 
This is no way to live if you don’t have to, and in the modern world,
we do not have to.
